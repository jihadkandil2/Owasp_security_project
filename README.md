# OWASP Juice Shop Penetration Testing Report

This repository contains the final deliverable for a comprehensive penetration testing project conducted on OWASP Juice Shopâ€”a deliberately insecure web application designed to simulate real-world vulnerabilities.

## Project Overview

Our objective was to identify, exploit, and document 20 critical vulnerabilities within the Juice Shop application. These include issues such as:

- **Broken Access Controls (Horizontal & Vertical)**
- **SQL and NoSQL Injections**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected, DOM, and Stored)**
- **Cryptographic Failures**
- **File Upload Bypass**
- **Broken Anti-Automation and Input Validation Issues**

We employed industry-standard tools (e.g., Burp Suite) and followed methodologies based on NIST SP 800-115 and the OWASP Testing Guide. The detailed report provides step-by-step reproduction instructions, impact assessments, and remediation recommendations.

## Repository Contents

- **Report Document:** The full penetration testing report.
- **Supporting Scripts & Tools:** Custom tools and scripts used during testing.
- **Screenshots & Evidence:** Visual proof supporting each finding.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates a deep understanding of web application vulnerabilities and offers actionable recommendations to enhance security. It serves as a valuable resource for developers, security professionals, and organizations looking to improve their application security posture.
